The NeuroIO library implements an HDF5-based format for storing
connectivity and morphological information of large neural networks,
perform parallel graph partitioning and analysis.

The graph component of NeuroIO assumes that synaptic connectivity
between neurons in neuronal network models is represented as directed
graphs stored as adjacency lists, where the vertices represent the
neurons in the network and are identified by unsigned integers called
unique global identifiers (gid).
